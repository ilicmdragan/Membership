## Description

This project is a website that I designed and developed with the help of ChatGPT. As an absolute beginner in the PHP language, I used ChatGPT to guide me through the process of building the website. The website includes a custom-designed model for data and a MySQL database.

I worked on this project for several months in my spare time, gradually learning and implementing different features with the help of ChatGPT. I found ChatGPT to be an incredible tool that provided me with valuable insights and guidance throughout the development process.

## Features
